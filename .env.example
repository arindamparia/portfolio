# Allowed CORS Origins (comma-separated)
#
# Development: Include localhost ports (required for local testing with Express server)
# Production: Only needed if you want to allow OTHER DOMAINS to call your API
#
# NOTE: In production, your site makes same-origin requests (yoursite.com → yoursite.com/api),
# so CORS doesn't apply. Only add production domains here if you want to allow cross-origin
# API calls from other websites you control.
#
# Examples:
# - Development only: http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000
# - With partner site: http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000,https://partner-site.com
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000
